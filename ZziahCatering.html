     ZZIAH CATERING & EVENTS — SUBPROJECT
=============================== -->

<section class="info-block livebolt-block">
  <p class="principles-intro">
    Zziah Catering &amp; Events is a community-based food service business operating in Mfuleni, Cape Town, owned and operated by professional chef Ziya Tunzi. The business provides home-cooked daily meals, catering for small family and corporate events, and specialty cake orders. Zziah Catering has a strong reputation for food quality and customer relationships, but previously operated with limited operational systems and administrative support.

     DELIVERABLE 1

<section class="info-block livebolt-block">
  <h2 class="block-title">Deliverable 1: Bookkeeping &amp; Financial Record-Keeping System</h2>

  <p class="principles-intro">
    <strong>Problem.</strong> Zziah Catering had no formal bookkeeping system. Business and personal finances were mixed, most transactions were cash-based, receipts were not saved, and there was no reliable way to determine monthly revenue, expenses, or profitability across different services.
  </p>

  <p class="principles-intro">
    <strong>Solution.</strong> Our team designed a simple bookkeeping framework to track sales, expenses, and revenue drivers using spreadsheet-based tools. The system emphasized separating business and personal transactions, logging daily meal orders, recording catering and cake revenue, and organizing expense records to enable basic financial visibility.
  </p>

  <p class="principles-close">
    <strong>Why this was the best solution.</strong> The system was intentionally low-tech and easy to maintain, aligning with the client’s limited time and preference for simplicity. It provided immediate financial clarity without requiring accounting software or extensive administrative effort.

     DELIVERABLE 2

<section class="info-block livebolt-block">
  <h2 class="block-title">Deliverable 2: Revenue Driver &amp; Profitability Analysis</h2>

  <p class="principles-intro">
    <strong>Problem.</strong> Ziya spent most of her time producing daily meals, despite uncertainty around whether this was the most profitable use of her time. There was no data-driven understanding of which services generated the highest margins or how pricing affected profitability.
  </p>

  <p class="principles-intro">
    <strong>Solution.</strong> We analyzed Zziah Catering’s three primary revenue streams—daily meals, catering events, and specialty cakes—by estimating contribution margins, variable costs, and break-even points. This analysis highlighted the relative profitability of each service and revealed where time and effort generated the greatest financial return.
  </p>

  <p class="principles-close">
    <strong>Why this was the best solution.</strong> The analysis transformed intuition into actionable insight. By clearly showing which services were most profitable, the client could make informed decisions about pricing, time allocation, and future growth without increasing operational complexity.

<section class="info-block livebolt-block">
  <h2 class="block-title">Deliverable 3: Cost Structure &amp; Operational Workflow Mapping</h2>

  <p class="principles-intro">
    <strong>Problem.</strong> The business operated with high variability in costs and relied heavily on memory and instinct to manage inventory, labor, and purchasing. This made planning difficult and increased the risk of inefficiencies as the business grew.
  </p>

  <p class="principles-intro">
    <strong>Solution.</strong> We mapped the full operational workflows for daily meals, catering events, and cake orders, documenting purchasing patterns, labor use, and delivery processes. This allowed costs and bottlenecks to be identified and tied directly to each revenue driver.
  </p>

  <p class="principles-close">
    <strong>Why this was the best solution.</strong> Process mapping created structure without disrupting existing operations. It preserved flexibility while enabling better planning, cost awareness, and capacity management as demand fluctuated.

  <h2 class="block-title">Deliverable 4: Strategic Direction &amp; Growth Planning</h2>

  <p class="principles-intro">
    <strong>Problem.</strong> Ziya had a strong long-term vision of transitioning the business into a restaurant and cultural space, but lacked the financial planning and operational structure needed to support sustainable expansion.
  </p>

  <p class="principles-intro">
    <strong>Solution.</strong> We evaluated the economics of the business, assessed capacity constraints, and identified risks associated with cash flow, labor dependency, and expansion timing. Recommendations emphasized strengthening core operations before scaling and aligning growth decisions with financial realities.
  </p>

  <p class="principles-close">
    <strong>Why this was the best solution.</strong> The approach balanced ambition with practicality. It supported the client’s vision while reducing risk and ensuring that future growth would be financially and operationally sustainable.
