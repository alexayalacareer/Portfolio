      <section class="info-block livebolt-block">
        <p class="principles-intro">
          This project was developed with the goal of modeling a complex, real-world object from my everyday life.
          I selected an acoustic-electric guitar specifically because it combines organic geometry, fine aesthetic
          detail, and functional mechanical components, making it an ideal test of advanced CAD modeling skills.
        </p>

        <p class="principles-close">
          The project began with direct observation of the physical instrument. Reference photos and countless
          measurements were used to establish overall proportions, surface curvature, hardware placement, and scale.
          From this physical reference, the guitar was recreated digitally as a complete CAD assembly, translating a
          familiar object into a structured, parametric model.

          The final CAD assembly consists of over 25 individual parts, all modeled from scratch. These include the
          guitar body, neck, fretboard, headstock, tuning machines, bridge, internal electronics, battery tray, and
          acoustic-electric control hardware. Several components were designed with functional intent, including
          moving tuners and internal electronic enclosures, requiring careful attention to fit, alignment, and
          assembly constraints.

        <p class="principles-intro">
          One of the primary challenges of this project was capturing the guitar’s complex, organic curves,
          particularly along the body and neck transitions. Converting smooth, free-form shapes into parametric
          geometry required extensive use of splines, lofts, sweeps, and surface modeling tools. Maintaining symmetry,
          managing changing cross sections, and preserving smooth curvature while retaining design intent required
          iterative refinement and experimentation within SolidWorks.

          Beyond static geometry, the project emphasizes assembly logic and functional understanding. Exploded
          assembly views were created to verify part relationships, internal layout, and component integration. This
          approach ensured that the final model reflected not only the external appearance of the instrument, but
          also how imagined components would realistically fit together.

          Component-level renders were used to highlight functional details within the design. These views show how
          elements such as the electronics cavity, battery tray, and bridge geometry were integrated into the guitar
          body while respecting spatial constraints and accessibility.

          Overall, this project demonstrates my ability to take a familiar but complex object and fully recreate it
          digitally through disciplined CAD modeling. It highlights skills in surface modeling, parametric design,
          assembly construction, and engineering documentation, as well as the ability to break down a complex system
          and build it from the ground up using professional design tools.
