        <p class="project-subtitle">
          Personal hobby focused on applied forecasting, real-time decision making, and risk management
          through independent storm chasing. Involves analyzing weather models, radar data, and
          atmospheric conditions to plan routes, assess uncertainty, and operate safely in dynamic,
          high-stakes environments.

        <p class="principles-intro">
          A few times a year, when my schedule and the weather line up just right, I’ll drive a few
          states away to chase thunderstorms and—if I’m lucky—see a tornado. Storm chasing isn’t like
          what you see on TV; most of it isn’t wild adrenaline but quiet analysis and patience. The
          excitement comes from forecasting, reading models, and interpreting the atmosphere—digging
          into HRRR runs, surface analyses, and Storm Prediction Center outlooks until the data starts
          to paint a story in the sky.

          It’s part science, part adventure. I get to travel across the country, see small towns far
          off the interstate, and meet people I’d never otherwise cross paths with. And when my
          forecast (I’m not a meteorologist—just a passionate observer) actually verifies, I find
          myself a few miles from a powerful thunderstorm: beautiful, chaotic, and humbling all at
          once.

          Chasing has taught me decision-making under pressure and risk management in a way few other
          experiences could. I chase solo, which means I’m forecasting, navigating, and driving all at
          once. I always plan my escape routes, monitor conditions carefully, and know when to pull
          back. I’ve chased in over a dozen states and seen several tornadoes—but I’ve also failed far
          more times, and those “bust days” taught me the most. I learned how to adapt, accept failure,
          and think clearly under stress.

          In those moments—balancing risk, analyzing data, and acting decisively—I see a lot of
          parallels to engineering. Both require critical thinking, awareness, and humility in the face
          of uncertainty. My storm chasing days might slow down as I take on more professional
          responsibilities, but the curiosity and respect for the power of nature that chasing gave me
          will always stay with me.
